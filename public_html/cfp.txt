Call for participation: Workshop on Inconspicuous Interaction
At CHI 2014 - April 26th 2014
http://inconspicuous.di.fc.ul.pt/

Growing usage of interactive systems in public spaces has highlighted the prevalence of conflicts between desired functionality and maintenance of privacy / social comfort. This has inspired researchers and practitioners to employ inconspicuous interaction styles.

This workshop is a venue for communities engaged in usable security, wearable and mobile interfaces, natural user interfaces, accessibility and social interaction to come together in sharing experiences and discussing avenues for future research. We are seeking position papers that can generate discussion and build bridges between these communities.

Topics of the workshop include:
- Designing and evaluating inconspicuous interfaces
- Making use of inconspicuous behavior in interactive systems
- Privacy-enhancing devices and interaction styles
- Private interactions in public displays
- Emerging privacy threats in social contexts
- Understanding social and cultural issues
- Understanding contextual interaction restrictions
- Methodological challenges
- Limits and unexplored affordances of current interfaces
